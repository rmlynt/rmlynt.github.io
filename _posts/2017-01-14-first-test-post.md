<h2>testing one two three</h2>
Is this thing on?

Everything seems to be working well.. figuring out the domain name switch from github to purchased took a while. Hopefully that's set now.

Things left to do:

* Figure out markdown language
* Figure out which responsive css framework to go with
* Implement said framework
* Rewrite/redesign CSS to fit aesthetics.
* Write an actual first blog
* Upload CV
* Write an about section
* Clean up the homepage
* Commit commit commit
